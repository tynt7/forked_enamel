Authoring App 
Version 1.0.0 Release Notes

Authots: Jeremy Winkler, Nisha Sharma, Tyler Thomson


The AuthoringApp allows instructors (our clients) to successfully create, 
edit and test scenarios for their students. These scenarios will help their
students learn Braille. The AuthoringApp also allows instructors to record
new audio files , save those files, play and insert in scenario after saving. 
The app is compatible to run on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. The
app also allows visually impaired users to interact with it. For this purpose,
the assumption is that those users have a screen reader software installed on 
their respective devices and know how to use it. 

The Runnable jar can be found inside AuthoringApp.zip folder. For full 
functionality, it is suggested to keep the AuthoringApp.jar in the same folder 
with the other libraries and jars. Please consult the documents in Documentation 
folder for further details.

An updated version with improved functionality and features is under 
construction. Stay tuned for the next update.
